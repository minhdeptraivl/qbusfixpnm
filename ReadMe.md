### How to use
1. Simple place all your ``.ttf`` files in the cloned folder.
2. Using your command line run the command:
``luvit s.lua``
3. With informative output you should see ``.gfx`` files popup up as the ``.ttf`` files are converted.
4. Stream them to FiveM as you would and register these fonts via a script, here's an example in Lua ([original](https://forum.cfx.re/t/fivem-update-may-5th-6th-2017/18200)):
```lua
local fontId

Citizen.CreateThread(function()
    RegisterFontFile('out') -- the name of your .gfx, without .gfx
    fontId = RegisterFontId('Fira Sans') -- the name from the .xml

    while true do
        Wait(0)
        SetTextFont(fontId)
        BeginTextCommandDisplayText('STRING')
        AddTextComponentString('Hello, world!')
        EndTextCommandDisplayText(0.5, 0.5)
    end
end)
```
